    <hr />
    <p style="font-size: 30px;">At its heart, HTML is a language made up of elements, which can be applied to pieces of
        text to give them
        different meaning in a document (Is it a paragraph? Is it a bulleted list? Is it part of a table?), structure a
        document into logical sections (Does it have a header? Three columns of content? A navigation menu?), and embed
        content such as images and videos into a page. This module will introduce the first two of these and introduce
        fundamental concepts and syntax you need to know to understand HTML.Before starting this module, you don't need
        any previous HTML knowledge, but you should have at least basic familiarity with using computers and using the
        web passively (i.e., just looking at it and consuming content). You should have a basic work environment set up
        (as detailed in Installing basic software), and understand how to create and manage files (as detailed in
        Dealing with files). Both are parts of our Getting started with the web complete beginner's module.</p>

    <hr />
    <p style="font-size: 30px;">HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the code that is used to structure a web page and
        its content. For example,
        content could be structured within a set of paragraphs, a list of bulleted points, or using images and data
        tables.HTML uses predefined tags and elements that instruct the browser on how to display the content. HTML
        elements include an opening tag, some content, and a closing tag. Itâ€™s important to remember to include closing
        tags. If omitted, the browser applies the effect of the opening tag until the end of the page.
        This section will dive into the basic structure of an HTML page, which includes essential building-block
        elements like doctype declaration, HTML, head, title, and body elements.</p>
