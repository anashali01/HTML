        <h1>About Drift</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>Drifting is a driving technique where the driver intentionally oversteers, with loss of traction, while
            maintaining control and driving the car through the entirety of a corner or a turn. <em> The technique causes the
            rear slip angle to exceed the front slip angle to such an extent that often the front wheels are pointing in
            the opposite direction to the turn </em>(e.g. car is turning left, wheels are pointed right or vice versa, also
            known as opposite lock or counter-steering). Drifting is traditionally performed using three methods: clutch
            kicking (where the clutch is rapidly disengaged and re-engaged with the intention of upsetting the grip of
            the rear wheels), weight transfer (using techniques such as the Scandinavian flick), and employing a
            handbrake turn. This sense of drift is not to be confused with the four wheel drift, a classic cornering
            technique established in Grand Prix and sports car racing.[citation needed]</p>

        <h1>History</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>Despite the popular belief that drifting originated in 1970s Japan, this driving technique was first
            practiced in Europe before 1950.[citation needed] Automotive icon Enzo Ferrari credits Italian driver Tazio
            Nuvolari as being the inventor of the four-wheel drift. <b> <mark> Later, British racing driver Stirling Moss improved
            upon Nuvolari's technique, mastering the art of drifting through curves in Formula 1 races by steering with
            the accelerator pedal. More recently, drifting as a specialized competition became popular in
            Japan</mark></b> . It was most popular in the All Japan Touring Car Championship races. Famous motorcyclist
            turned driver Kunimitsu Takahashi was the foremost creator of drifting techniques in the 1970s. This earned
            him several championships and a legion of fans who enjoyed the spectacle of smoking tires. The bias-ply
            racing tires of the 1960s–1980s lent themselves to driving styles with a high slip angle. As professional
            racers in Japan drove this way, so did street racers.[5]

           <ins> Keiichi Tsuchiya, known as the "Drift King" (ドリフトキング, Dorifuto Kingu), became particularly interested in
            Takahashi's drift techniques.</ins> Tsuchiya began practicing his drifting skills on the mountain roads of Japan,
            and quickly gained a reputation amongst the racing crowd. In 1987, several popular car magazines and tuning
            garages agreed to produce a video of Tsuchiya's drifting skills. The video, known as Pluspy,[6] became a hit
            and inspired many of the professional drifting drivers on the circuits today. In 1988, alongside Option
            magazine founder and chief editor Daijiro Inada, he helped to organize one of the first events specifically
            for drifting called the Ikaten (short for Ikasu Hashiriya Team Tengoku). He has also drifted through every
            turn in Tsukuba Circuit.[citation needed]</p>
