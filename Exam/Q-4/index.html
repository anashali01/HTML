        <h1>Japan </h1>
        <p>Japan[b] is an island country in East Asia. <mark><ins> It is located in the Pacific Ocean off the northeast coast of the
            Asian mainland, and is bordered on the west by the Sea of Japan and extends from the Sea of Okhotsk in the
            north to the East China Sea in the south.</ins></mark> The Japanese archipelago consists of four major islands—Hokkaido,
            Honshu, Shikoku, and Kyushu—and thousands of smaller islands, covering 377,975 square kilometres (145,937 sq
            mi). Japan has a population of nearly 124 million as of 2024, and is the eleventh-most populous country. Its
            capital and largest city is Tokyo; the Greater Tokyo Area is the largest metropolitan area in the world,
            with more than <b> 38 million inhabitants as of 2016. Japan is divided into 47 administrative prefectures and
            eight traditional regions.</b> About three-quarters of the country's terrain is mountainous and heavily
            forested, concentrating its agriculture and highly urbanized population along its eastern coastal plains.
            The country sits on the Pacific Ring of Fire, making its islands prone to destructive earthquakes and
            tsunamis.</p>
